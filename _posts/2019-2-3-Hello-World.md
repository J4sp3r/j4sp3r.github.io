Hi there! I am a cyber security ehtusiast and I love to play Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. On this blog I will post write-ups and my opinion on CTFs and cyber security in general. But I try to do things a bit differently than just publishing write-ups.

Instead, I try to make them easy to read by not only providing the solution, but also the way I approach these challenges and how I look at them. The goal is for you, my dear reader, to learn as much as possible from it. I know from my own experience that learning skills for CTFs is hard. It can take a long time and it can be frustrating when you do not succeed. (I have some theories on this, but that is for a later blogpost) 

But fear not! I intend to help you on your path to develop your skills and take you along the ride of playing CTF competitions. Do not forget; be eager to learn new things but treasure what you already know.

As I am new to writing these kind of blogs - and as a challenge to you - I would like to ask you to place a comment about how you feel about this post. I love to hear your opinion and would like to make the next post even better. Thank you for reading!
